# Content Management System / Blog
Blog software comparable to WordPress or Blogger.

This started as my university senior project. I returned to it and improved the code and processes a bit, but I haven't worked on it since 2012. It was the launchpad to my web development career and I enjoyed building it.

Update 2021:
I've started some refactoring.

TO DO: 
* add .sql file for building the needed database tables
* move credentials to environment variables and exclude from version control
* convert SQL queries to use MySQLi or PDO_MySQL and parameterize all user input
* use Twig templating
* audit for OWASP vulnerabilities
* add ability to like, share articles
* use "I am not a robot" instead of CAPTCHA
* add a tag/category to articles
